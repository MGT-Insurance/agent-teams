# Shared execution contract

The DRI owns integration. Give every delegated track the initiative id, project `EPIC_ID`, exact bead ids, absolute worktree, file-disjoint ownership, role boundary, stop conditions, and required verification. Work beads use `--parent <EPIC_ID>`. Role configuration owns the model; do not override it.

Use one git worktree per implementation track, never an independent clone. Record each `track-worktree:` before spawning, provision live environment only through `ateam worktree-setup <absolute-path>`, and operate across checkouts by absolute path or `git -C`/`bd -C` without changing the DRI's session cwd.

Implementers add code and core-path tests but never push, merge, or deploy. Testers own edge cases and live verification. Reviewers never fix. The DRI verifies artifacts, integrates the composed branch, routes findings to fresh implementers, and repeats integration verification after every ring. Loop closure requires both integrated code and an observable end-to-end exercise; tests alone are insufficient.
